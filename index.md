### CPSC 120

* Lab 1

   Lab 1 was a favorite and gave us entry-level work, and the main program we used in almost every lab being the integers. This taught us the essential action of printing “Hello World”.  This was our first lab, and it was fun to know this was my intro to a long coding journey.

* Lab 2

Lab 2 was a favorite, similar to lab 7 part 1 because you create code to print text and input nouns to complete the sentence. This was fun because of the endless possibilities you can use to make the sentences. This lab taught us to use “cin” and “cout, " a vital tool for beginner code and output text.

* Lab 7

Lab 7 Part 1 was a favorite because of how engaging and creative the lab was while still helping me learn code. Making the sandwich was fun; it was the first lab I ultimately led. This lab was also helpful because it taught us to use and read the command line.
